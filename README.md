To pre-comput the text-to-voice recordings use `ELEVENLABS_KEY=<ELEVENLABS_KEY> node generate_audio_files.mjs` from root folder. There is also `/pages/api/get_audio_direct.ts` which is able to get the audio directly from elevenlabs (need to adapt api call). It is deprecated but might be useful in the future if needed and currently not in use.
